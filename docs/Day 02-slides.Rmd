# Variable types

.pull-left[

Typically, within R, we work with 5 different types of data:

- Numerics
   - Integers
   - Decimals (aka double)

- Characters

- Factors

- Dates

- Logical

]

--

.pull-right[

- Use .blue[`is.`] functions to test
   - `is.integer()`
   - `is.double()` (checks for decimal)
   - `is.numeric()` (checks if either integer ___or___ double)
   - `is.character()`
   - `is.factor()`
   - etc.

- Use .blue[`as.`] functions to coerce
   - `is.integer()`: coerce to integer
   - `is.double()`: coerce to double
   - `is.character()`: coerce to character
   - etc.
