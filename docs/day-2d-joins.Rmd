# Types of joins

To work with relational data you need join operations that work with pairs of tables.  There are two families of verbs designed to work with relational data:

.pull-left[

* __Mutating joins__: add new variables to one data frame by matching observations in another.

* __Filter joins__:  filter observations from one data frame based on whether or not they match an observation in the other table.

.pull-right[

```{r dplyr-hex, echo=FALSE, out.height="60%", out.width="60%"}

# Prerequisites

.pull-left[

### Packages

```{r pkgs}
library(tidyverse) # or library(dplyr)
```

]

.pull-right[

### Example data

```{r join-setup}
x <- tribble(
  ~key, ~val_x,
     1, "x1",
     2, "x2",
     3, "x3"
)
y <- tribble(
  ~key, ~val_y,
     1, "y1",
     2, "y2",
     4, "y3"
)
```

```{r join-setup-image, echo=FALSE, out.width="35%"}

# Prerequisites

### Exercise data

```{r exercises-data}
transactions <- data.table::fread("data/transactions.csv", data.table = F) %>% as_tibble()
products     <- data.table::fread("data/products.csv", data.table = F) %>% as_tibble()

# Keys `r anicon::faa("key", animate = FALSE, colour = "red")`

.font120[

- __keys__ are variables that connect pairs of tables
- A primary key uniquely identifies an observation in its own table
- A foreign key uniquely identifies an observation in another table

.font120[

* Filtering joins affect the observations rather than adding variables

* Use when wanting to filter one data set based on foreign key variables in another data set
