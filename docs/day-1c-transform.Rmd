# dplyr

You are going to learn six key .bold[dplyr] functions that allow you to solve the vast majority of your data manipulation challenges:

.pull-left[

* .bold[`filter`]: pick observations based on values

* .bold[`select`]: pick variables

* .bold[`summarize`]: compute statistical summaries 

* .bold[`group_by`]: perform operations at different levels of your data

* .bold[`arrange`]: reorder data

* .bold[`mutate`]: create new variables

]

.pull-right[

<br>
```{r dplyr-hex, echo=FALSE, out.height="50%", out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/dplyr.png")
```
<br>
]

# Basics

.font130[All functions work similarly:]
.font120[
* The first argument is a data frame
* Subsequent arguments describe what to do
* Output is a new data frame
]
