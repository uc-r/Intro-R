# Introduction to R

### Course Description

Welcome to Intro to R\! This short course provides a gentle, hands-on
introduction to the R programming language for data science
applications. You will learn the fundamental skills required to import,
tidy, transform, manipulate, and visualize real world consumer data. The
following is an outline of the material covered in this training:

### Course Preparation

To prepare for this course please complete the following ***prior*** to
the day of class:

1.  Download the class material
    [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/uc-r/Intro-R/tree/master/student-material).
    This will provide you with a zipped file that contains the data and
    R scripts to follow along during class. I have also included handy
    cheat sheets that you can reference throughout different sections.
    Be sure to unzip this file and save it in an easy to reach directory
    for the workshop.

2.  All slides are available via the hyperlinks in the schedule above so
    that you can follow along.

3.  Please have the following versions of R and RStudio installed. If
    you have an earlier version of R that is at least version 3.4.5 or
    later you should be ok but its best to be as current as possible.
    
      - R: 3.6.1 \[[download latest
        version](https://cran.r-project.org/)\]
      - RStudio: 1.2.5001 \[[download latest
        version](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)\]
      - Visit [here](http://uc-r.github.io/basics#installation) if you
        need installation instructions

If you have any specific questions prior to the class you can reach out
to me (Brad Boehmke) directly at <bradleyboehmke@gmail.com>
